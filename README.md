CredSniper 🔐

CredSniper is a beginner‑friendly ESP8266 project that helps you learn how Wi‑Fi security works through simple demonstrations.





What is CredSniper?

<p>
CredSniper is a small tool that runs on an ESP8266 board and creates a Wi‑Fi access point with a web control panel.  
It is designed to help beginners understand how wireless attacks work so they can learn how to **protect networks better**.
</p><p>
This project focuses on learning, testing, and awareness — not real‑world abuse.
